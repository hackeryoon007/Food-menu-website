This image shows a web-based food menu UI in Figma, divided into three core vertical artboards:

1. Main Page
Features two daily specials with star ratings.

Menu preview section with pasta, lasagna, etc.

"Our Story" and "We are ready to serve you" CTA at the bottom.

Acts as the homepage.

2. Wines Page
Similar hero as the main page for consistency.

Displays wine bottles with prices and high-quality imagery.

Arrows show prototype links between main to wine section and back.

3. Steak Page
Features juicy steak meals with pricing, star ratings, and variety.

Navigable from either the main page or wine page using prototype arrows.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The Main Page acts as the landing page with anchor links to wine and steak pages.

Users interact with "View More" or "Specials" to navigate deeper.

All pages maintain a consistent footer CTA to book or explore.

The prototype flow in Figma allows you to simulate user interaction and transitions.
